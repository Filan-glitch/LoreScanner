# App Initialization Changes

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to improve app initialization by adding a splash screen and centralizing initialization logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Splash Screen Support
- Added `flutter_native_splash` package for native splash screen generation
- Created `flutter_native_splash.yaml` configuration file
- Added custom splash screen widget with loading indicators

### 2. Centralized Initialization Logic
- Created `InitializationService` class to handle all app initialization
- Moved camera initialization from `main.dart` and `ScannerScreen`
- Moved database initialization from `ScannerScreen`
- Centralized provider initialization

### 3. Updated App Structure
- Modified `main.dart` to use `SplashWrapper` instead of directly showing `HomePage`
- Updated `ScannerScreen` to receive initialized data instead of initializing itself
- Added proper error handling and retry functionality

## Architecture

### InitializationService
- Singleton service that handles all app initialization
- Manages camera initialization
- Manages database initialization
- Provides centralized access to initialized resources

### SplashWrapper
- Custom widget that displays splash screen during initialization
- Shows loading progress with status messages
- Handles initialization errors with retry functionality
- Transitions to HomePage when initialization is complete

## Benefits
1. **Improved User Experience**: Users see a branded splash screen instead of a blank screen
2. **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with retry functionality
3. **Cleaner Code**: Separation of concerns with initialization logic in one place
4. **Reliability**: Ensures all dependencies are initialized before use
5. **Performance**: Optimized initialization order

## Testing
- Added unit tests for `InitializationService`
- Added widget tests for `SplashWrapper`
- Added integration tests for app launch flow

## Usage
The app now automatically shows a splash screen on launch and initializes all dependencies before showing the main interface. No additional configuration is needed.

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed initialization progress tracking
- Implement background initialization for faster subsequent launches
- Add initialization performance metrics
